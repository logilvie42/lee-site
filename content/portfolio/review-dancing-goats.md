I’m always jonesing for a good cup of coffee and one of my favorite places is Dancing Goats Coffee Bar, which just so happens to be right on the BeltLine! I used to love going to their Decatur location, but it was a little too out of the way for frequent visits (traffic, of course, being the deciding factor), so I was delighted when they opened their Old Fourth Ward location a few years ago.

Dancing Goats was one the first businesses to open up at Ponce City Market. Over the past couple years it’s been really interesting to watch the whole structure develop. When they first opened, they had a miniature model of PCM replete with little trees and tiny plastic visitors, offering a little sneak peek of what it would be a part of. The model has since been moved to the market itself and replaced with spacious wooden tables that can comfortably accommodate six strangers on laptops or four very gesticulative friends.

While their menu may seem understated and simple, their coffee is not. The espresso always comes out with a natural subtle sweetness and a full-bodied flavor that transports you into the indecisive paradox of wanting to drink more because it is so good but also wanting to savor and enjoy it. The thing I like to do at coffeehouses is to ask the barista to make me their favorite drink, and I encourage you to do the same! Baristas in local coffee shops know their stuff and there are competitions held right here in Atlanta on perfect pulls and pours so, should you feel adventurous, connect with that person and take advantage of their expertise.

Mornings have been gray and chilly as of late, but once it warms up, I can’t wait to sit out on their giant screened-in patio and compete with everyone for the hanging day beds in the back by their barrel fountain. Don’t worry- they don’t swing enough to ironically spill coffee on yourself!

Now go forth, be curious, and try something new at Dancing Goats Coffee Bar! I guarantee it will be delicious.
