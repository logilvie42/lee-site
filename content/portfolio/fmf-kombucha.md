This past Saturday I went to check out the Green Market at Piedmont Park. As I mentioned last week, March 18th kicked off their 2017 season and I was itching to see what other vendors had in store. Or booth, rather!

As I headed to what seemed like the front of the market, I bumped into my friend Wes, who was selling Golda Kombucha. Golda is Georgia’s first kombucha tea company and is locally brewed. The two flavors they had that day were lavender lemonade and blackberry mint. I sampled both and found that it was a little too dreary and chilly out for the lemonade, so I opted to purchase a 16oz bottle of the blackberry mint. It was a little on the sweeter side, which tamed the often potent tang of the kombucha. If you buy Golda at the farmers’ market, they encourage you to bring back your empty (and washed) bottles for a refill at a tiered discount! If you’re a kombucha enthusiast, this can add up. Plus the bottles are really pretty!

I perused the market some more for some unique finds. One of the vendors had some ground goat for sale! While tempted, I wasn’t entirely sure what recipe I would use it for, but it has definitely stayed in my thoughts for the past week. I picked up some fresh strawberries from Taylor Orchards. Their samples were a little riper than the ones I bought and then devoured as soon as I got home. I think if I had waited to eat them, they would have been a little
sweeter.

I would say my favorite item I purchased was the lemon ghee from Saivori’s booth. You can gussy up any vegetable with this stuff! I steamed some carrots I had from a previous farmers’ market visit and melted about a teaspoon on them. They were delectable! A little bit goes a long way, so start with a small amount. Saivori is not always at the Green Market, so you can check out their website in the meantime or look for their ghees at Candler Park Market!

The last purchase I made was some kale from Flyinghorse Farm’s booth to make a salad when I got home. I shaved some of the remaining carrots I had with a vegetable peeler and massaged in some zest and juice of a lemon and an orange with a little olive oil. After letting it sit in the fridge for a few hours while I was at work, I came home to a refreshingly crisp and tangy salad to eat while I soaked up the sunshine.

I’ll see y’all next week with some new foods and recipes to share!
