Octane Coffee Bar is one of Atlanta's mostly highly celebrated coffee institutions. Starting on the West Side in 2003, they have steadily expanded their business to several locations around town. In 2011, they opened their Grant Park location across the street from Oakland Cemetery and a stoneâ€™s throw from the BeltLine. They've joined up with The Little Tart, an outstanding local bakery.

I decided to go around 11am on a Wednesday and it was pleasantly bustling. Their tall ceilings and large industrial windows welcome in lots of natural sunlight. Patrons and their laptops were sitting at long tables with benches and chairs in the front and back of the shop, while friends gathered at the smaller and more intimate tables in between.

As I headed to the counter, sinfully delicious pastries from The Little Tart whispered like quiet, glutinous sirens. While their sandwiches look wonderfully enticing, I recommend you throw all savory prerogatives to the wind and try the dark chocolate and almond meringue. While many meringues initially look fluffy only to be found crumbly and dry, these meringues live up to all preconceived notions. They are huge, soft, and succulent.

I couldn't figure out what I wanted exactly because I know anything I get from here will be great. After the barista asked me a series of either/or questions, my choose-your-own-coffee adventure ultimately pointed me to their cortado, which has become my beverage of choice as of late. I sat closest to the counter so I could stare into the kitchen and at the pastries. My cortado arrived in a little glass with a spoon, artfully presented with a little latte leaf. It had a lovely viscosity and had hints of caramel and little punches of brown sugar! I decided not to sweeten it because I would drink it too quickly if I did.

Parking at Octane can be a little tricky for those by car, as Six Feet Under has claimed a good portion of the parking lot, but there is ample parking for cyclists. As it is the season, I recommend getting your coffee to go as you wander through Oakland Cemetery on one of their <a href="http://www.oaklandcemetery.com/?event=capturing-the-spirit-of-oakland-halloween-tours"> Halloween ghost tours</a>. But even if you find yourself just cresting over from Cabbagetown into Grant Park, stop by Octane to fuel the rest of your journey!
